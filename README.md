# Hello

Electrical Engineering student at Washington State University focused on **RF systems**, **embedded development**, **robotics**, and **digital logic**. I love to build low‑level systems with an emphasis on clarity, maintainability, simplicity, and hands‑on engineering.

## Technical Focus
+ **Embedded Systems** - ARM, C/C++, bare‑metal workflows  
+ **RF Engineering** - FCC ham technician certification in progress  
+ **Digital Logic & Hardware** - Verilog, FPGA workflows, hardware bring‑up  
+ **Robotics & Control** - microcontrollers, sensors, real‑time systems  
+ **Manufacturing** - CNC machining, 3D printing, mechanical integration  

---

## Featured Projects
+ **Custom Kernel Project** - Linux‑inspired file system, scheduler, and memory model  
+ **Robotics Platform (v1 & v2)** - embedded control, sensor fusion, mechanical design  
+ **CNC Machining Projects** - precision parts, fixtures, and manufacturing workflows  
+ **Fitbit Data Analysis** - clean, minimal data‑processing pipeline

## About Me
Hello, my name is Gus Ballman, and I’m an electrical engineering student at Washington State University. I’ve always been drawn to building systems that matter, and my interests span coding, science, economics, and manufacturing. I like understanding how things work and how they connect.
Over time, I’ve become especially fascinated by radio frequency engineering and communication systems. The idea that we can shape electromagnetic waves and use them to move information across the world still amazes me. With society becoming increasingly dependent on Wi Fi and cloud based technologies, I believe RF engineering will only grow in importance. My goal is to help make these communication systems more efficient, reliable, and accessible.

I’m studying RF concepts in my spare time and working toward my FCC Ham Radio certification to explore the field more deeply. I want to contribute to the innovation that keeps the world connected. My mission is to improve both the hardware and software behind modern communication systems and helping push technology forward in a meaningful way.

Alongside this focus, I’m strengthening my foundation in embedded systems, robotics, digital logic, and manufacturing. I like developing full systems that span ARM assembly, C/C++, Verilog hardware design, 3D printed prototypes, and CNC machined components. My current projects include developing a monolithic kernel for an ARM Cortex A9, contributing to my robotics team’s second generation undercutter battlebot, and completing my Six Sigma Green Belt certification. I continue to grow through hackathons, coursework, and hands on engineering work.

Overall, I want to use engineering to help move the world forward by improving the systems that connect us and by contributing to the innovations that shape our future.
